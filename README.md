## 🚚 Community Delivery System

### Delivery Status Flow
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → READY_FOR_PICKUP → PICKED_UP → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
```

### Deliverers
- Verified through ID, route, and transport method (motorcycle, bicycle, or walking)
- Confirm pickups and deliveries using digital verification codes
- Operate within the community delivery model, often leveraging public transport routes

### Auto-Tracking
- Each transaction creates a `delivery_tracking` record
- Both pickup and delivery verification codes are digitally generated and confirmed

---

## 💸 Fintech System (Sparza Token - SPZ)

### Sparza Token (SPZ)
A simulated digital currency for internal transactions.

- **Initial Balance**: Each new user starts with 1,000–2,000 SPZ
- **Exchange Rate**: 1 SPZ = R1.00 (mock rate)

### Key Features:
- Deposit / Withdraw / Transfer SPZ between users
- Transaction history tracking in `token_transactions` and `token_balances_history`
- API endpoints under `/api/fintech/...`
- Fintech Dashboard for balance viewing, transaction logs, and transfers
